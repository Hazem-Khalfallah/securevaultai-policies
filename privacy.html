        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: February 14, 2026</p>

        <p>SecureVault AI is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our mobile application SecureVault AI (the "App").</p>

        <h2>1. No Data Collection</h2>
        <p>SecureVault AI is designed with your privacy as the highest priority. <strong>We do not collect, store, or share any personal data.</strong> All data you create, store, or manage within the App remains exclusively on your device and is never transmitted to our servers or any third party.</p>

        <h2>2. Local-Only Storage</h2>
        <p>All your information—including documents, passwords, and security settings—is stored locally on your device using encrypted storage mechanisms provided by your operating system. We do not have access to this data, and it never leaves your device.</p>

        <h2>3. Biometric Authentication</h2>
        <p>If you choose to enable biometric authentication (fingerprint or face recognition), the biometric data is handled entirely by your device's secure hardware and operating system. We never receive or store your biometric information.</p>

        <h2>4. In-App Purchases</h2>
        <p>Payments and subscriptions are processed by the Google Play Store. SecureVault AI does not collect or store any payment information. Please refer to Google's Privacy Policy for details on how they handle your data.</p>

        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The App does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. We believe in complete transparency: there are no hidden trackers or data collectors.</p>

        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our App is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>
