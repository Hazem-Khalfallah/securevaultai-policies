        <h2>1. Use of the App</h2>
        <p>SecureVault AI is a personal security tool that helps you store sensitive documents, passwords, and other data locally on your device. You may use the App only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms.</p>

        <h2>2. Local Data Responsibility</h2>
        <p>All data you store in the App remains on your device. You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your device and your data. We strongly recommend enabling device encryption and using a strong PIN or biometric lock.</p>
        <p><strong>We cannot recover your data if you forget your PIN or lose access to your device.</strong> Please ensure you keep backups of any critical information outside the App.</p>

        <h2>3. In-App Purchases</h2>
        <p>SecureVault AI offers premium subscriptions (monthly, yearly) and a lifetime purchase. All purchases are processed by the Google Play Store and are subject to Google's terms. Payments are non-refundable except as required by applicable law.</p>
        <ul>
